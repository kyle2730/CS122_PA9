~Shooter game:
-Multiplayer game(?), controls movement with "wasd" keys and controls shooting direction with mouse. 
Played on two computers using docker. 

Rules:
Two opponents can shoot at each other. They both have three lives, indicated by the color of their icon.
Once someone is hit three times, they die and the other player wins.

The game will include powerups and powerdowns, which include:
Hearts- extra life (max of 3). If you get a heart when you have 3 hearts, it gives you a temporary shield.
Forward arrows- Speeds player up
Arrows pointing out- ring of bullets fly everywhere
Lightning Bolt- Rate of fire increase
Back arrows- slows character down
Bomb- blows up and takes heart if in blast radius.
Andy- Totally random (says "Good morning!") 

Seperate Andy Idea: at some point during game text flashes "Andy's coming" then Andy's face flies in and kills anyone who is moving (Toy story reference, Andy's coming: all toys play dead)
